# Welcome to Our Infrastructure Documentation

Welcome to the heart of our infrastructure! This documentation is designed to give you an in-depth look at how we build, manage, and scale our systems using Terraform and Terragrunt. Whether you're a new team member, a curious developer, or just looking to understand our setup better, you'll find comprehensive details and clear explanations here.

From VPC configurations and subnet allocations to CI/CD pipelines and remote state management, we cover it all. Dive in and explore how we maintain a robust, secure, and efficient infrastructure across our development, pre-production, and production environments.

Happy exploring!
